Overview and Objectives
===
- The world has in the past decades experienced succession of fire disasters. These disasters have claimed many thousands of life, caused material looses and afflicted terrible toll. Thus, people need to be well equipped in terms of knowledge on how to prevent and react to fire outbreaks.
- In our final project, we try to design a website with several visualizations to help show the 911 fire alarm calls happened in Seattle, the main dataset is downloaded from Seattle official website. We design a very useful website that explore the data by year, season, type and location. We also combined this data with other related information online to help analyze the data in a reasonable manner.

Basic Visualizations
===
- Location Visualization: using maps(population density & 911 fire alarm calls density) to show the distribution of each calls type in the dotted map. It contains type selection button.
- Year Visualization: using brush and time window to show different types distribution.
- Type Visualization: using bar chart and pie chart (legend related) to show exploratory data of amount in each month and each type. With mouseon and mouseover functions, and year selection button.
- Season Visualization: Data is calculated based on season. Click one line of the form, and show selected type's disribution. Click again to remove it form the figure. 

Data Analysis Conclusions
===
- From the type visualization, we can see that months 7, 8, 9 contains more 911 calls than other months in the four years mostly. And as years grows, the average incidents number becomes bigger, we consider that this is because population is increasing continuously.
- From the year visualization, we find out that there are some sudden growths and falls. For example, in end of year 2012 and beginning of year 2013, there is a sudden fall in type Aid Response. While in end of year 2013 and beginning of 2014, there is a sudden growth in type Auto Fire Alarm and in type Trans to AMR as well. 
We also find out that the data mostly changes smoothly and the amount of each 
type almost contains the same with a subtle changing over time.
-	From the location visualization, we can see that the different type has different density distribution. But it is all related to population density. This can be noticed by comparing two maps. It is also a very straightforward visualization to see the data in detail. It is very useful for government and fire work department to allocate resources rationally.
-	From the season visualization, we can find that in summer, the temperature and humidity are both high. Compare to this, we find that most of the 911 fire calls happens in summer while winter contains the lowest frequency of 911 calls.
